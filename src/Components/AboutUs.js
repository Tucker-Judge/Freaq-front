      <p>
        Did you know that you only need to know around 1000 to 3000 words to understand about 80% of
        a language in general, and that the first 1000 words make up about 80% of the words used in
        everyday conversation and media?

      Learning a new language can be a fun and rewarding experience with many benefits. Here are a few reasons why I believe learning a new language is worth considering:

It opens doors to new cultures and experiences: Speaking another language allows you to connect with people from different cultures and understand their perspectives. You'll also be able to travel to new places and experience different cultures in a deeper and more meaningful way.

It enhances your cognitive abilities: Studies have shown that learning a new language can improve your memory, concentration, and problem-solving skills. It can also delay the onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

It boosts your career prospects: Knowing a second language can make you more competitive in the job market, especially in industries that require global communication. Bilingual employees are in high demand and are often offered higher salaries.

It's a fun challenge: Learning a new language is a challenge, but it's also a fun and rewarding one. It's exciting to see yourself progress and become more proficient in a language over time. Plus, it's a great way to meet new people and make new friends.

Overall, learning a new language is a worthwhile investment that can enrich your life in many ways. It may take some effort and dedication, but the rewards are well worth it.
