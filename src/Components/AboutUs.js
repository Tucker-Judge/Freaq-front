      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that you only need to know around 1000 to 3000 words to understand about 80% of
        a language in general, and that the first 1000 words make up about 80% of the words used in
        everyday conversation and media?
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning 30 words a day teaches you 1000 words in a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why our platform focuses on helping language learners master the most frequently used
        words and phrases first, so that they can start using the language in real-life situations
        as soon as possible.
